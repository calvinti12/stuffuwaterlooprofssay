This is a simple web app built using Flask and Bootstrap, made to publish specifically generated images to a Facebook page I manage.

While it has very specific functions written to generate these images, the rest of the structure of the web app is pretty general and could be used for similar personal tools you might want to build (do something based on a single form).

It contains authentication implemented using Flask-Login, an SQL database to handle user accounts, and a very simple form template created using Bootstrap. It also contains some files required for Heroku, since the tool is deployed on Heroku.
